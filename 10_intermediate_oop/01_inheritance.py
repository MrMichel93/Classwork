# TODO 1: Define a parent class called 'Animal'
# Add an __init__ method that takes 'name' and 'species'
# Store them as instance attributes
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Add a method 'make_sound' to Animal
# For now, just print "Some generic animal sound"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Add a method 'info' to Animal
# It should print the animal's name and species
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Define a child class 'Dog' that inherits from Animal
# Use: class Dog(Animal):
# For now, just use 'pass' in the body
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Create a Dog instance
# Pass "Buddy" and "Canine" to the constructor
# Notice how Dog inherits the __init__ from Animal
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Call the info() method on the Dog instance
# It should work because Dog inherited it from Animal
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Define another child class 'Cat' that inherits from Animal
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Create a Cat instance with name "Whiskers" and species "Feline"
# Call both info() and make_sound() methods
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Define a parent class 'Vehicle' with:
# - __init__ taking: brand, model, year
# - method 'display_info' that prints the vehicle details
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Create a child class 'Car' that inherits from Vehicle
# Add an additional method 'honk' that prints "Beep beep!"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Create a Car instance
# Call display_info() (inherited) and honk() (new method)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Create another child class 'Motorcycle' that inherits from Vehicle
# Add a method 'rev_engine' that prints "Vroom vroom!"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Create instances of both Car and Motorcycle
# Call their unique methods to show they have different capabilities
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a three-level inheritance hierarchy
# Example: Vehicle -> ElectricVehicle -> TeslaCar
# Each level should add new methods or attributes
# Write your code here:
