Mini-Program 2: Set Operations
Topic: Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries

Learning Objectives:
- Create and initialize sets
- Understand set uniqueness (no duplicates)
- Perform set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Use set methods to add and remove elements

Instructions:
Complete this program to practice working with sets.

# TODO 1: Create a set called 'fruits' with: "apple", "banana", "orange"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Print the set
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Add "grape" to the fruits set
# Hint: Use fruits.add("grape")
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Print the updated set
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Try to add "apple" again (it should have no effect since sets don't allow duplicates)
# Print the set after adding
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create another set called 'citrus' with: "orange", "lemon", "lime"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Find the union of fruits and citrus (all unique items from both)
# Hint: Use fruits.union(citrus) or fruits | citrus
# Store in a variable called 'all_fruits' and print it
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Find the intersection of fruits and citrus (common items)
# Hint: Use fruits.intersection(citrus) or fruits & citrus
# Store in a variable called 'common_fruits' and print it
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Find the difference (items in fruits but not in citrus)
# Hint: Use fruits.difference(citrus) or fruits - citrus
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Remove "banana" from the fruits set
# Hint: Use fruits.remove("banana") or fruits.discard("banana")
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Check if "apple" is in the fruits set
# Hint: Use "apple" in fruits
# Print the result (True or False)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Create a set from a list with duplicates: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
# See how the set automatically removes duplicates
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Print the length of the fruits set
# Hint: Use len(fruits)
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create two sets of numbers and find their symmetric difference
# (items that are in either set, but not in both)
# Hint: Use set1.symmetric_difference(set2) or set1 ^ set2
# Write your code here:
