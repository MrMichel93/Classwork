# TODO 1: Create a dictionary called 'student' with keys: "name", "age", "grade"
# Values: "Alice", 15, "10th"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Print the entire dictionary

# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Access and print the student's age
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Add a new key-value pair: "school" with value "Central High"
# Hint: student["school"] = "Central High"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Print the updated dictionary
# Write your code here:

# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a dictionary with mixed value types:
# integers, strings, lists, and even another dictionary
# Example: {"name": "Bob", "scores": [90, 85, 88], "address": {"city": "NYC", "zip": "10001"}}
