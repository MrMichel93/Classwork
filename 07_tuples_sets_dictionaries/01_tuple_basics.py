# TODO 1: Create a tuple called 'coordinates' with three values: 10, 20, 30
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Print the entire tuple
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Print the first element of the tuple (index 0)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Print the last element using negative indexing
# Hint: Use coordinates[-1]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Print the length of the tuple
# Hint: Use len(coordinates)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Unpack the tuple into three variables: x, y, z
# Hint: x, y, z = coordinates
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Print each unpacked variable
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Create a tuple called 'colors' with ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Use slicing to get the first two colors
# Hint: colors[0:2] or colors[:2]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Count how many times "red" appears in the colors tuple
# Hint: Use colors.count("red")
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Find the index of "blue" in the colors tuple
# Hint: Use colors.index("blue")
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Create a tuple with one element (single-element tuple)
# Hint: Remember to include a comma: single = (5,)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Try to concatenate two tuples: (1, 2) + (3, 4)
# Store the result in a variable called 'combined'
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a tuple of tuples (nested tuple) representing
# points on a 2D plane: ((0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4))
# Access and print the y-coordinate of the second point (which is 2)
# Write your code here:
