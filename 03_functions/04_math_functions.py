# TODO 1: Define a function called 'find_max' that takes two parameters: a and b
# It should return the larger of the two numbers
# Hint: Use an if statement
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Define a function called 'find_min' that takes two parameters: a and b
# It should return the smaller of the two numbers
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Test find_max and find_min with the numbers 15 and 23
# Print both results
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Define a function called 'calculate_average' that takes two parameters
# It should return the average of the two numbers
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Define a function called 'is_positive' that takes one parameter: number
# It should return True if the number is positive, False otherwise
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Define a function called 'absolute_value' that takes one parameter
# It should return the absolute value of the number (always positive)
# Hint: If the number is negative, return its negative (which makes it positive)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Test absolute_value with -15 and print the result
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Define a function called 'calculate_circle_area' that takes one parameter: radius
# It should return the area of a circle (pi * radius * radius)
# Use 3.14159 for pi
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Define a function called 'calculate_circle_circumference' that takes radius
# It should return the circumference (2 * pi * radius)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Test both circle functions with a radius of 5
# Print both results with descriptive labels
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Define a function called 'find_max_of_three' that takes three parameters
# It should return the largest of the three numbers
# Hint: You can use the find_max function you already created
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Define a function called 'calculate_bmi' that takes two parameters:
# weight_kg and height_m
# It should return the BMI (Body Mass Index): weight / (height * height)
# Write your code here:
