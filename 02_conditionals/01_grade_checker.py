Mini-Program 1: Grade Checker
Topic: Conditionals

Learning Objectives:
- Use if, elif, and else statements
- Compare values using comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==)
- Create branching logic in programs
- Understand how conditions control program flow

Instructions:
Complete this grade checker program that assigns letter grades based on scores.

# TODO 1: Create a variable 'score' and set it to 85
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create an if statement to check if score >= 90
# If true, print "Grade: A"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Add an elif statement to check if score >= 80
# If true, print "Grade: B"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Add an elif statement to check if score >= 70
# If true, print "Grade: C"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Add an elif statement to check if score >= 60
# If true, print "Grade: D"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Add an else statement for scores below 60
# Print "Grade: F"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Add another check - if score is greater than 100 or less than 0,
# print "Invalid score" (do this BEFORE the grade checks)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Test your program with different score values
# Try: 95, 82, 77, 65, 45, -5, 110
# Change the score variable and run the program multiple times
# Write your test notes here as comments:


# BONUS TODO: Add a check that prints "Perfect score!" if score equals 100
# This should happen in addition to printing the grade
# Write your code here:
