"""
Mini-Program 3: Number Comparator
Topic: Conditionals

Learning Objectives:
- Compare two or more values
- Use comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Practice nested if statements
- Determine relationships between numbers

Instructions:
Complete this program that compares numbers and determines their relationships.

# TODO 1: Create two variables 'num1' and 'num2'
# Set num1 = 15 and num2 = 20
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Check if num1 is equal to num2
# If true, print "The numbers are equal"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: If they're not equal, check if num1 is greater than num2
# If true, print "The first number is larger"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: If num1 is not greater, print "The second number is larger"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Calculate and print the difference between the larger and smaller number
# Hint: You might need to use another if statement or the abs() function
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a third variable 'num3' and set it to 15
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Check if num1 and num3 are equal
# If true, print "num1 and num3 are equal"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Check if all three numbers are equal
# Use 'and' operator: if num1 == num2 and num2 == num3:
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Check if at least two numbers are equal
# Use 'or' operator to check multiple conditions
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Determine if num2 is between num1 and num3 (inclusive)
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Check if num1 is even or odd and print the result
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) - if num % 2 == 0, it's even
# Write your code here:
