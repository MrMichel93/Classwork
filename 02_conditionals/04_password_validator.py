# TODO 1: Create a variable 'password' and set it to "Secret123"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Check if the password length is at least 8 characters
# Hint: Use len(password) to get the length
# If true, print "Length is good"
# Otherwise, print "Password too short"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Check if the password contains at least one digit
# Hint: You can check if any of '0' through '9' is in the password
# For now, just check if '1' or '2' or '3' is in password (simplified)
# If true, print "Contains a number"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a variable 'username' and set it to "user123"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Check if the password is the same as the username
# If true, print "Error: Password cannot be the same as username"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Check if the password contains the word "password" (case-insensitive)
# Hint: Use password.lower() to convert to lowercase first
# If true, print "Error: Password cannot contain the word 'password'"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Create a variable 'confirm_password' and set it to "Secret123"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Check if password and confirm_password match
# If they match, print "Passwords match!"
# Otherwise, print "Passwords do not match"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Create a combined validation check
# Password is valid if: length >= 8 AND password != username
# Print "Password is valid" or "Password is invalid"
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter
# Hint: You can check if password != password.lower()
# This means there's at least one uppercase character
# Write your code here:
