# TODO 1: Create a string 'word' with the value "Python"
# Use a for loop to print each character on a separate line
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create a string 'text' with the value "Hello, World!"
# Use a for loop to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in the text
# Print the count
# Hint: Check if each character is in "aeiouAEIOU"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Create a string 'message' with the value "programming"
# Use a for loop to count how many times the letter 'm' appears
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a string 'sentence' with the value "Learning Python is fun"
# Use a for loop to count how many spaces are in the sentence
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Create a string 'data' with the value "abc123xyz"
# Use a for loop to count how many digits are in the string
# Hint: Use character.isdigit() to check if a character is a digit
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a string 'phrase' with the value "Hello World"
# Use a for loop to build a new string with only consonants
# Print the result
# Hint: For each character, check if it's NOT a vowel and NOT a space
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Create a string 'code' with the value "Python"
# Use a for loop to create a new string where each character is repeated twice
# Result should be: "PPyytthhoonn"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Create a string 'text' with the value "Hello, Python!"
# Use a for loop to count uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and other characters
# Print all three counts
# Hint: Use character.isupper() and character.islower()
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Create a string 'password' with the value "Secret123"
# Use a for loop to check if the password contains at least one digit
# Print True or False
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a string "level" (a palindrome)
# Use a loop to verify if it's a palindrome (reads same forwards and backwards)
# Compare each character from the start with its corresponding character from the end
# Write your code here:
