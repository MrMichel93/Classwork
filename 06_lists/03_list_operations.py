Mini-Program 3: List Operations
Topic: Lists

Learning Objectives:
- Perform operations on lists (concatenation, repetition, slicing)
- Use list comprehensions (simple introduction)
- Work with multiple lists
- Extract sublists using slicing

Instructions:
Complete this program to practice list operations.

# TODO 1: Create two lists: list1 = [1, 2, 3] and list2 = [4, 5, 6]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Concatenate list1 and list2 to create list3
# Hint: Use the + operator
# Print list3
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Create a list with [1, 2, 3] and repeat it 3 times
# Hint: Use the * operator: [1, 2, 3] * 3
# Print the result
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a list 'numbers' with [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Get the first 5 elements using slicing
# Hint: numbers[0:5] or numbers[:5]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Get the last 3 elements using slicing
# Hint: numbers[-3:]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Get every other element using slicing with step
# Hint: numbers[::2]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Get elements from index 2 to 7 (not including 7)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Create a reversed version of the numbers list using slicing
# Hint: numbers[::-1]
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Find the sum of all numbers in the list
# Hint: Use sum(numbers)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Find the maximum value in the list
# Hint: Use max(numbers)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Find the minimum value in the list
# Hint: Use min(numbers)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Create a list of squares using a loop
# Start with an empty list, loop from 1 to 10, append each square
# Result should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a list of even numbers from 0 to 20 using list comprehension
# Hint: [x for x in range(21) if x % 2 == 0]
# Write your code here:
