# TODO 1: Create a list 'fruits' with ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
# Use a for loop to print each fruit
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create a list 'numbers' with [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Use a for loop to print each number multiplied by 2
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Using the same numbers list, create a new list 'doubled'
# that contains each number from numbers multiplied by 2
# Use a for loop and append() method
# Print the doubled list
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a list 'scores' with [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]
# Use a for loop to calculate the average score
# Print the average
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Create a list 'words' with ["python", "java", "javascript", "ruby"]
# Use a for loop to count how many words have more than 5 characters
# Print the count
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a list 'temperatures' with [72, 68, 75, 82, 79, 73]
# Use a for loop to find the highest temperature
# Don't use max() function - do it manually in the loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Create a list 'items' with ["apple", "BANANA", "Cherry", "DATE"]
# Use a for loop to create a new list with all items in lowercase
# Print the new list
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Create a list 'nums' with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Use a for loop to create two new lists:
# - even_nums: contains only even numbers
# - odd_nums: contains only odd numbers
# Print both lists
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Create a list 'prices' with [19.99, 24.50, 15.00, 32.99]
# Use a for loop to calculate the total price
# Apply 8% tax to the total
# Print the final total
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Create a list 'grades' with [88, 92, 79, 85, 97, 91]
# Use a for loop with enumerate() to print each grade with its index
# Example: "Grade 0: 88", "Grade 1: 92", etc.
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create two lists: names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
# and ages = [25, 30, 35]
# Use zip() in a for loop to print each name with their age
# Example: "Alice is 25 years old"
# Write your code here:
