# TODO 1: Implement a function to remove duplicates from a list
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 6]
# Create a new list with no duplicates (preserving order)
# Don't use set() - implement manually with a loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
# list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Merge them without using sort()
# Result should be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Use two pointers to compare and merge
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Rotate a list to the right by k positions
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# k = 3
# Result: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# Use list slicing to achieve this
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Find the intersection of two lists
# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Find common elements: [4, 5]
# Don't use set operations - use nested loops
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Partition a list into two lists based on a condition
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Separate into even and odd lists
# even_list and odd_list
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Implement list chunking
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# chunk_size = 3
# Result: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Split list into chunks of specified size
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Flatten a nested list
# nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Use nested loops to extract all elements
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Find all pairs that sum to a target value
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# target = 10
# Find all pairs: (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6)
# Use nested loops, avoid duplicates
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Implement a sliding window maximum
# numbers = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
# window_size = 3
# For each window, find maximum:
# [1,3,-1] -> 3
# [3,-1,-3] -> 3
# [-1,-3,5] -> 5
# Print all window maximums
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Move all zeros to the end
# numbers = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12, 0, 5]
# Result: [1, 3, 12, 5, 0, 0, 0]
# Maintain order of non-zero elements
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Find the kth largest element
# numbers = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
# k = 2
# Find the 2nd largest element (answer: 5)
# Don't use sort - implement selection algorithm
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Create a running sum list
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Result: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
# Each element is sum of all previous elements plus itself
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Implement list element frequency counter
# letters = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd', 'b']
# Create a list of tuples: [('a', 3), ('b', 3), ('c', 1), ('d', 1)]
# Count frequency of each unique element
# Write your code here:


# TODO 14: Find longest increasing subsequence length
# numbers = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
# Find length of longest increasing subsequence
# Example: [2, 3, 7, 101] has length 4
# Use nested loops to check all possibilities
# Write your code here:


# TODO 15: Implement a three-way partitioning (Dutch National Flag)
# numbers = [2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
# Partition into three groups: all 0s, then all 1s, then all 2s
# Result: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
# Do this in-place if possible
# Write your code here:


# TODO 16: Find missing number in sequence
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# The list should contain numbers 1-8, find missing: 4

# Difference is the missing number
# Write your code here:


# TODO 17: Implement list difference (elements in list1 but not in list2)
# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# BONUS TODO: Implement a list-based LRU cache simulator
# capacity = 3
# access_pattern = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
# Simulate Least Recently Used cache:
# - Cache can hold 'capacity' items
# - When full, remove least recently used item
# - Track cache state after each access
# Print cache contents after each access
