# Compound Interest Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
# Where:
# A = Final amount (what you want to calculate)
# P = Principal (initial amount)
# r = Annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
# n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
# t = Time in years

# TODO 1: Create a variable 'principal' and set it to 1000.0 (initial investment)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create a variable 'annual_rate' and set it to 0.05 (5% interest)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Create a variable 'times_compounded' and set it to 12 (monthly)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a variable 'years' and set it to 10
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Calculate the rate per period: rate_per_period = annual_rate / times_compounded
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Calculate the total number of periods: total_periods = times_compounded * years
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Calculate (1 + rate_per_period) and store in 'growth_factor'
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Calculate growth_factor raised to the power of total_periods
# Store it in 'compound_multiplier'
# Hint: Use the ** operator for exponents
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Calculate the final amount: final_amount = principal * compound_multiplier
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Calculate the interest earned: interest_earned = final_amount - principal
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Print the principal, final amount, and interest earned with labels
# Format the output to 2 decimal places
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Calculate and print the percentage gain
# percentage_gain = (interest_earned / principal) * 100
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Compare different compounding frequencies
# Calculate the final amount if compounded annually (n=1) instead of monthly
# Store in 'final_amount_annual' and compare with monthly compounding
# Write your code here:


# TODO 14: Calculate how much more money you earn with monthly vs annual compounding
# Store and print the difference
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a retirement savings scenario:
# Initial investment: $5000
# Monthly contribution: $200 (add to principal each year)
# Annual rate: 7%
# Time: 30 years
# Calculate final amount for this complex scenario
# Note: This is advanced - you'll need to estimate by treating contributions
# as adding to the principal
# Write your code here:
