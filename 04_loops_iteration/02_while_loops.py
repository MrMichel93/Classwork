# TODO 1: Create a variable 'counter' and set it to 1
# Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
# Don't forget to increment counter inside the loop!
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create a variable 'countdown' and set it to 10
# Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1
# Print each number
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Create a variable 'total' and set it to 0
# Use a while loop to add numbers from 1 to 20 to total
# Print the final total
# Hint: Create another variable for the current number
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a variable 'number' and set it to 1
# Use a while loop to double the number until it exceeds 1000
# Print the number each time it doubles
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Create a variable 'power' and set it to 1
# Use a while loop to calculate 2^10 (2 to the power of 10)
# Don't use the ** operator, use multiplication in a loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a variable 'guess' and set it to 1
# The secret number is 7
# Use a while loop to keep incrementing guess until it equals 7
# Print "Found it!" when you find the number
# Print how many guesses it took
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Create a variable 'num' and set it to 100
# Use a while loop to divide num by 2 until it's less than 1
# Print num each time
# Count how many divisions occurred
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Implement a simple number guessing game
# Set a secret number, use a while loop to simulate guesses from 1 to 100
# Print when you find the secret number and how many tries it took
# Write your code here:
