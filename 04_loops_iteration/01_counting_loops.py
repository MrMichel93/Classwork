Mini-Program 1: Counting Loops
Topic: Loops and Iteration

Learning Objectives:
- Use for loops with the range() function
- Understand loop iteration and counters
- Print values during iteration
- Work with loop variables

Instructions:
Complete this program to practice basic loop structures and counting.

# TODO 1: Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
# Hint: for i in range(1, 11):
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Use a for loop to print numbers from 0 to 9
# Hint: range(10) starts at 0 and goes up to (but not including) 10
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Use a for loop to print only even numbers from 2 to 20
# Hint: range(2, 21, 2) - the third parameter is the step
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Use a for loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1 (countdown)
# Hint: range(10, 0, -1) - negative step counts backwards
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Use a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100
# Store the result in a variable called 'total'
# Print the total after the loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for 5 (5x1 to 5x10)
# Format: "5 x 1 = 5", "5 x 2 = 10", etc.
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Use a for loop to count how many numbers from 1 to 50 are divisible by 3
# Store the count and print it
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Use a for loop to print the first 10 square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
# Hint: Square of i is i * i or i ** 2
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Use nested for loops to print a multiplication table from 1x1 to 5x5
# Format it nicely in rows and columns
# Write your code here:
