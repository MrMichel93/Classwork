# TODO 1: Create a multiplication table using nested loops
# Print a 10x10 multiplication table
# Outer loop: for i in range(1, 11)
# Inner loop: for j in range(1, 11)
# Print i * j with formatting
# Hint: Use print(f"{i*j:4}", end="") to format columns, then print() after inner loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Create a triangle pattern with numbers
# Print:
# 1
# 1 2
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3 4
# 1 2 3 4 5
# Use nested loops: outer loop controls rows, inner loop prints numbers
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Create a descending triangle pattern
# Print:
# 5 4 3 2 1
# 5 4 3 2
# 5 4 3
# 5 4
# 5
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create a number pyramid
# Print:
#     1
#    121
#   12321
#  1234321
# 123454321
# Hint: Need to print spaces first, then ascending numbers, then descending
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Find all pairs of numbers that sum to a target
# Create a list: numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
# target_sum = 14
# Use nested loops to find all pairs (i, j) where numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target_sum
# Make sure i < j to avoid duplicates
# Print each pair
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a matrix (2D list) using nested loops
# Create a 5x5 matrix where each element equals row * column
# Store in a list of lists: matrix = []
# Print the matrix in a formatted way
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Transpose a matrix (swap rows and columns)
# Given matrix from TODO 6, create a transposed version
# If original matrix[i][j] = value, then transposed[j][i] = value
# Print both original and transposed matrices
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Find the sum of each row in the matrix
# Loop through each row and calculate the sum of its elements
# Print the sum for each row
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Find the sum of each column in the matrix
# Loop through each column and calculate the sum
# Print the sum for each column
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Search for a value in the matrix
# search_value = 12
# Use nested loops to find if the value exists
# If found, print its position (row, column)
# If not found, print "Value not found"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Create a prime number checker using nested loops
# For each number from 2 to 50:
#   Check if it's prime by testing divisibility
#   Use a nested loop to test all numbers from 2 to number-1
#   If divisible by any, it's not prime
#   Print all prime numbers found
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Generate all combinations of two lists
# list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C']
# list2 = [1, 2, 3]
# Print all combinations: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Create a diamond pattern
# Print:
#    *
#   ***
#  *****
# *******
#  *****
#   ***
#    *
# Use nested loops with careful control of spaces and stars
# Write your code here:


# TODO 14: Implement bubble sort using nested loops
# Create a list: unsorted = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
# Use nested loops to sort the list (bubble sort algorithm)
# Outer loop: for i in range(len(list))
# Inner loop: for j in range(len(list) - i - 1)
# Compare adjacent elements and swap if needed
# Print the sorted list
# Write your code here:


# TODO 15: Find duplicate numbers in a list using nested loops
# Create a list: numbers = [5, 3, 8, 3, 9, 5, 1, 8, 2]
# Use nested loops to find and print all duplicates
# Make sure to print each duplicate only once
# Write your code here:


# TODO 16: Create a checkerboard pattern
# Print an 8x8 checkerboard using 'X' and 'O'
# Alternate between X and O
# Pattern starts with X in top-left corner
# Write your code here:


# TODO 17: Calculate the sum of diagonals in a square matrix
# Use the matrix from TODO 6
# Calculate sum of main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
# Calculate sum of anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
# Print both sums
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Generate Pascal's Triangle
# Print the first 7 rows of Pascal's Triangle
# Each number is the sum of the two numbers above it
# Row 0: 1
# Row 1: 1 1
# Row 2: 1 2 1
# Row 3: 1 3 3 1
# Row 4: 1 4 6 4 1
# Use nested loops to calculate and print
