Mini-Program 4: Loop Accumulation
Topic: Loops and Iteration

Learning Objectives:
- Use loops to accumulate values (sum, product, count)
- Track maximum and minimum values
- Build strings and lists using loops
- Apply accumulator pattern

Instructions:
Complete this program to practice accumulating values in loops.

# TODO 1: Use a for loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100
# Store in a variable called 'sum_total' and print it
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Use a for loop to calculate the product of numbers from 1 to 10 (factorial of 10)
# Store in a variable called 'product' (start with 1, not 0!)
# Print the result
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Use a for loop to count how many even numbers exist between 1 and 100
# Store the count and print it
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Use a for loop to find the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 50
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Use a for loop to build a string that contains all vowels repeated 3 times
# Start with empty string: result = ""
# Loop through "aeiou" and add each letter 3 times
# Print the final string
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a list of numbers: [5, 12, 8, 3, 19, 7, 15, 2]
# Use a for loop to find the maximum value in the list
# Don't use the max() function - do it with a loop
# Hint: Start with max_value = list[0], then compare each element
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Using the same list from TODO 6, find the minimum value
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Using the same list, calculate the average of all numbers
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Use a for loop to count how many numbers in the list are greater than 10
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Use a for loop to create a new list containing only the even numbers
# from the original list
# Start with: even_numbers = []
# Use: even_numbers.append(num) to add numbers
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10
# (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2)
# Write your code here:
