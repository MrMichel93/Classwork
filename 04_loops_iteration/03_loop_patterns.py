# TODO 1: Use a for loop to print 10 asterisks in a row: **********
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Use a for loop to print 5 rows of 10 asterisks each
# Result should be a 5x10 rectangle of asterisks
# Hint: You'll need a nested loop or print "*" * 10 inside a loop
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Use a nested for loop to print a right triangle pattern:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# Hint: Outer loop for rows, inner loop for asterisks in each row
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Use a for loop to print numbers in a triangle pattern:
# 1
# 12
# 123
# 1234
# 12345
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Use a for loop to print a square with a border:
# *****
# *   *
# *   *
# *   *
# *****
# Hint: First and last rows are all stars, middle rows have stars at edges only
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Use a for loop to print a countdown pattern:
# 54321
# 5432
# 543
# 54
# 5
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Use a loop to print alternating characters:
# *-*-*-*-*-
# Hint: Check if the loop counter is even or odd
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a pyramid pattern:
#     *
#    ***
#   *****
#  *******
# *********
# Hint: You need spaces before the stars, and the number of stars increases oddly
# Write your code here:
