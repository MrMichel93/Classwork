# TODO 1: Define a class 'Product' with __init__ taking: name, price, quantity
# Store these as instance attributes
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Add a method 'get_total_value' to Product
# It should return price * quantity
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Add a method 'display_info' to Product
# It should print the product's name, price, and quantity
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Create three Product instances with different items
# Example: Product("Laptop", 999.99, 5)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Store all three products in a list called 'inventory'
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Use a for loop to display info for each product
# Call the display_info() method on each product
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Calculate the total value of all products in inventory
# Use a loop and the get_total_value() method
# Print the grand total
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Define a class 'Student' with: name, age, and grades (list of numbers)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Add a method 'calculate_average' to Student
# It should return the average of the grades list
# Hint: sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Add a method 'add_grade' to Student
# It should append a new grade to the grades list
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Create a list of at least 3 Student instances
# Give each student different grades
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Loop through the students list
# Print each student's name and their average grade
# Write your code here:


# TODO 13: Find the student with the highest average
# Store in a variable and print their name
# Hint: Use a loop or max() with a key function
# Write your code here:


# TODO 14: Add a new grade to each student
# Loop through students and call add_grade() with a new value
# Print the updated averages
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a 'Library' class that manages a list of Book objects
# Book should have: title, author, available (boolean)
# Library should have methods to add books and check out books
# Create a library, add books, and test checking them out
# Write your code here:
