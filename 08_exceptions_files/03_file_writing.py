Mini-Program 3: File Writing
Topic: Exceptions & Files

Learning Objectives:
- Write data to files in Python
- Understand different file modes (w, a, r+)
- Use the with statement for file operations
- Append data to existing files

Instructions:
Complete this program to practice writing to files.
"""

# TODO 1: Create a new file called 'output.txt' and write one line to it
# Use 'w' mode (write mode - creates new file or overwrites existing)
# Write the line: "This is the first line"
# Hint: with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
# Write your code here:


# TODO 2: Open 'output.txt' and verify the content was written
# Read and print the contents
# Write your code here:


# TODO 3: Write multiple lines to a new file called 'poem.txt'
# Use the write() method with newline characters
# Write at least 3 lines of text
# Write your code here:


# TODO 4: Append a new line to 'output.txt' (don't overwrite existing content)
# Use 'a' mode (append mode)
# Add the line: "This is an appended line"
# Write your code here:


# TODO 5: Read and print 'output.txt' to see both lines
# Write your code here:


# TODO 6: Create a list of items: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# Write each item to a new file called 'fruits.txt' (one per line)
# Use a for loop to write each item
# Write your code here:


# TODO 7: Create a function called 'write_list_to_file' that:
# - Takes a filename and a list as parameters
# - Writes each list item to the file on a separate line
# - Uses try-except to handle any IOError
# Write your code here:


# TODO 8: Test your write_list_to_file function
# Create a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Write them to 'numbers.txt'
# Write your code here:


# TODO 9: Write a dictionary to a file in a readable format
# Create a dictionary: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Boston"}
# Write each key-value pair as: "key: value"
# Save to 'person.txt'
# Write your code here:


# TODO 10: Read back the 'person.txt' file and print its contents
# Write your code here:


# TODO 11: Create a function that writes multiple lines at once
# Use the .writelines() method with a list of strings
# Remember to add newline characters yourself
# Write your code here:


# TODO 12: Use 'r+' mode to read and write to the same file
# Open 'output.txt' in 'r+' mode
# Read the content, then append another line
# Write your code here:


# BONUS TODO: Create a simple log function that appends
# timestamped messages to a file called 'log.txt'
# Hint: Use datetime module for timestamps
# Write your code here:
